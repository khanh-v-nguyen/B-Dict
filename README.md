# THUMB-RULE for Dev

1. Use YARN, not NPM. How to start? run `yarn start`
2. **NEVER WORK ON THE MAIN BRANCH** !!
   - Create a local branch with `your-name/branch-name` and work on there
3. **NEVER DO PROP DRILLING** !!
   - Always love custom hooks and context provider
4. Avoid using useEffect as much as possible. It creates a lot of side-effects and is very expensive
5. Since we are not using typescript, be careful of types!
